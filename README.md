# Python-Projects-OF-14yrs-Boy
Hi, Iâ€™m Abishek Shrestha, a 14-year-old enthusiast from Nepal with a passion for technology and data! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m a beginner in Python and just getting started with GitHub to share my projects and learn from the amazing developer community. My dream is to become a Data Scientist, where I can explore the world of data, solve real-world problems, and make a meaningful impact.

Iâ€™m excited to grow my skills, collaborate with others, and take steps toward achieving my goal. Letâ€™s connect, share knowledge, and create something incredible together! ðŸŒŸ
